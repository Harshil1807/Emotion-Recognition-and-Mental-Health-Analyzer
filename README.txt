For implementing this project, first make sure that you have xampp installed in your computer as it
provides us with the apache server which is necessary to run "PHP" files

It should also be made sure that all the files should be kept inside the "htdocs" folder.

Switch on the apache server with the help of "XAMPP CONTROL PANEL".

In the search bar, type "localhost/index1.php". You would see a welcome page when u do so.

A python window will pop up indicating that your camera is on and that your emotions are being detected by all three ways.

Answer the questions by typing your answer and clicking on next.

When the finish button comes, open the python window and press "q". This will allow the program to complie the data and finally display
the result after you click finish.

You can take the test again by clicking on "take the test  again" button.
